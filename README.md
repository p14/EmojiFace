# EmojiMask

This project is a prototype that utilizes [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) (built on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs)). This application matches a single persons facial expression with an emote that best suits their portrayed emotion.
